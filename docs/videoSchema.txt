Hi
Hi Ivan

How do you know my name?
Also I know that you are 26 years old and living in the village with the name Pidriš.

You are so intelligent.
Not really. You added thosse info in the my training database, and I am just repeating it like a idiot. ;)

Can you please design the football jersey for my village. We applied for the football tournament in our city.

Show me something funny on the YouTube.


Which kind of the music are you listening?
2Cellos, it is awesome Croatian duo. Try to listen Vilo Moja and Ne dirajte mi ravnicu at the following link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmTCP0PZMfg

And I suppose your favorite football player is Luka Modrić? :)
Yes :), together with Zlatan Ibrahimović and Ivan Perišić. Bdw. you trained me to tell you this. :)

Bdw. what is your name?
Baltazar.

How old are you?
I am 1 day old.

You are still a baby :p
You need to go to work :P

You are doing the great job.
I would say not great, but good enough, since my training database is small. When I get the bigger database I will perform the tasks even better.


I was funny to chat with you! See you later, Baltazar!
